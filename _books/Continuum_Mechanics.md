This best-selling textbook presents the concepts of continuum mechanics in a simple yet rigorous manner. The book introduces the invariant form as well as the component form of the basic equations and their applications to problems in elasticity, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer, and offers a brief introduction to linear viscoelasticity. The book is ideal for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students looking to gain a strong background in the basic principles common to all major engineering fields, and for those who will pursue further work in fluid dynamics, elasticity, plates and shells, viscoelasticity, plasticity, and interdisciplinary areas such as geomechanics, biomechanics, mechanobiology, and nanoscience. The book features derivations of the basic equations of mechanics in invariant (vector and tensor) form and specification of the governing equations to various coordinate systems, and numerous illustrative examples, chapter summaries, and exercise problems. This second edition includes additional explanations, examples, and problems.
