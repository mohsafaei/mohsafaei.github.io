I am a researcher with a strong academic background in Nonlinear Solid Mechanics. I completed my M.Sc. at the University of Tehran (2021–2024) with a high GPA of 3.88. My research focused on the multiphysics behavior of smart materials, including Shape Memory Polymers (SMPs), hydrogels, and Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs). 📚

I have a strong background in various topics, including nonlinear constitutive modeling, finite element analysis, continuum mechanics, and multiscale modeling. Additionally, I am familiar with Artificial Intellignce (AI) and am eager to explore their applications in mechanical science. 🚀

I also like camping, canyoning and reading. ⛺️📚
