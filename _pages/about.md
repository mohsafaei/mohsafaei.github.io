I’m a researcher with a strong academic background in **Nonlinear Solid Mechanics** and **Finite Element Analysis** ✨. I completed my **M.Sc. at the University of Tehran** (#340 in QS Ranking) with a **GPA of 3.88**. My research interests include the multiphysics modeling of smart materials—such as **Shape Memory Polymers (SMPs)**, **hydrogels**, and **Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs)**. 📚💡  

I have a solid foundation in **continuum mechanics** and **constitutive modeling**, and I want to use this knowledge to help push the boundaries of science, especially in areas connected to **human health** ❤️🩹. I truly believe that by doing so, we can all move toward a better, healthier life together 🌍✨.  

Oh, and beyond the lab—I love **camping ⛺️, canyoning 🌊, and reading 📖** too 😉.
