**Research is more than just collecting data—it's about discovering insights and sharing them with others.**

So, it is not only about conducting a study; it's about solving a problem. Many things are involved in solving a problem, and you need essential tools and techniques to conduct an in-depth scientific investigation. These tools empower you to explore questions systematically, analyze data critically, and present your findings impactfully.

All these skills are taught and reviewed in the **Research Methodology** course. Research Methodology is a foundational course that provides you with these skills — and I believe these skills are what distinguishes someone with an academic background from others.
