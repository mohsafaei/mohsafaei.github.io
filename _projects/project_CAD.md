# Introduction to CAD Drawing

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) drawing is the process of using specialized software to create precise 2D and 3D models for engineering, architecture, and product design. Unlike manual drafting, CAD offers increased accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency in creating, modifying, and analyzing designs.

## What is CAD?

CAD refers to the use of computer systems to assist in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. It is widely used in mechanical engineering, architecture, civil engineering, electronics, and many other fields.

## Popular CAD Software

- AutoCAD  
- SolidWorks  
- CATIA  
- Siemens NX  
- Fusion 360  
- SketchUp  

# CAD Files Portfolio

Welcome to my curated collection of CAD drawings (mostly created by SolidWorks) and models. On this page, you can explore various CAD designs created by me for various engineering and design projects. Each CAD file demonstrates technical expertise in mechanical design and product development.

## About These CAD Files

This portfolio showcases 2D and 3D CAD drawings created using industry-standard software. The files include:

- Mechanical parts and assemblies  
- Product prototypes and industrial designs  

Each file is available for download or preview, providing insight into the design process and technical specifications.

## How to Use These Files

- **Download:** Access the original CAD files compatible with software such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360.  
- **Preview:** View rendered images and 3D models directly in your browser (where supported).  
- **Reference:** Use these files for educational purposes, design inspiration, or project collaboration.
