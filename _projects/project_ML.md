### Origin
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming. The roots of ML can be traced back to early statistical modeling and pattern recognition in the 1950s. Over time, advancements in computational power and data availability have significantly shaped its evolution:

- **1950s–1970s**: Early ML models emerged from statistical theories, with foundational work in linear regression and decision trees.
- **1980s–1990s**: The introduction of artificial neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) expanded ML capabilities.
- **2000s–2010s**: The rise of big data and cloud computing enabled large-scale ML applications, leading to breakthroughs in deep learning.
- **2020s–Present**: ML is now widely used in fields such as healthcare, finance, automation, and scientific research, with growing integration into AI-driven decision-making systems.
